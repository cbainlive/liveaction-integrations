1) Replace <LIVENX-SERVER-IP> with the IP address of your LiveNX server.

2) Replace <Management> with desired source interface (Note:  Should be the same interface used to poll the device via SNMP)

3) Adjust interface Ethernet# to specify the interfaces you wish to monitor. Apply the flow tracker to each relevant interface as needed.

Note: May need to add "no sflow enable" to interface getting converted from sflow to IPFIX.




! Disable sFlow globally to prevent conflicts
no sflow run

! Enable IP routing for IPFIX packets to be routed to the collector

! Define the sampled flow tracker
flow tracking sampled
   tracker LiveNX-Tracker
      sample 1000
      no shutdown

! Define the flow exporter and associate it with the tracker
flow tracking sampled
   tracker LiveNX-Tracker
      exporter LiveNX-Exporter
         collector <LIVENX-SERVER-IP> port 2055
         local interface <Management>
         template interval 300000
         no shutdown

! Apply the flow tracker to the desired interfaces
interface Ethernet1
   flow tracker sampled LiveNX-Tracker
   no shutdown

interface Ethernet2
   flow tracker sampled LiveNX-Tracker
   no shutdown
