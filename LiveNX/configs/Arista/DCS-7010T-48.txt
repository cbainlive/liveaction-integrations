1) Replace <LIVENX-SERVER-IP> with the IP address of your LiveNX server.

2) Replace <Management> with desired source interface (Note:  Should be the same interface used to poll the device via SNMP)

3) Adjust interface Ethernet# to specify the interfaces you wish to monitor. Apply the flow tracker to each relevant interface as needed.

Note: May need to add "no sflow enable" to interface getting converted from sflow to IPFIX.
